# Alloy: High-Performance Event Ingestion Engine

**Alloy** is a distributed, high-throughput event ingestion system architected in **Rust**. It is designed to handle massive ingestion spikes (16,000+ RPS) while maintaining strict idempotency guarantees and database integrity.

The system is optimized for **horizontal scalability**, utilizing a multi-layered caching strategy and asynchronous backpressure mechanisms to protect downstream resources.

## ⚡ Engineering Highlights

* **15k RPS Arrival Rate:** Designed and benchmarked to sustain 15,000 requests per second on a single instance.
* **Multi-Level Idempotency:** Utilizes a lock-free **L1 Cache (DashMap)** for sub-microsecond local deduplication and a **Redis-backed L2 Cache** using **MGET pipelining** for global consistency.
* **Asynchronous Backpressure:** Implemented via bounded **MPSC channels**. The system proactively exerts backpressure (HTTP 503) when the internal buffer (100k capacity) reaches saturation, protecting the database from cascading failures.
* **Optimistic Persistence:** Features a "Double-Buffering" strategy where API handlers acknowledge receipt in **<2ms**, while dedicated background workers manage batching and persistence to **ClickHouse**.
* **Zero-Copy Architecture:** Leverages Rust’s ownership model and Serde to minimize allocations during high-frequency JSON parsing.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The engine is structured as a **Cargo Workspace** to enforce clear separation of concerns:

1.  **`ingestion-api`**: An Axum-based web server optimized for high concurrency and non-blocking I/O.
2.  **`billing-core`**: Shared domain logic and optimized data structures.
3.  **`billing-db`**: Database abstraction layer managing Redis multiplexing and ClickHouse batch inserts.



### Data Flow
1.  **Request Arrival**: Axum receives a JSON payload.
2.  **L1 Filter**: Instant check against a local `DashMap` to drop immediate duplicates in RAM.
3.  **Buffered Handoff**: Payload is pushed to a bounded MPSC channel. If full, a `503 Service Unavailable` is returned (**Circuit Breaking**).
4.  **Worker Processing**: Parallel workers pull batches (10,000 events) from the channel.
5.  **L2 Global Check**: Workers perform a batched `MGET` against Redis to verify idempotency across the cluster.
6.  **Batched Insert**: Unique events are flushed to ClickHouse using `async_insert` for maximum disk I/O efficiency.

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Benchmarks were conducted using **k6** with a `constant-arrival-rate` executor to simulate an "Open System" load, ensuring consistent pressure regardless of server response time.

### Results at Peak Saturation
| Metric | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Target Arrival Rate** | 20,000 RPS |
| **Max Operations (Checks)** | **32,319/s** |
| **Sustained Success Rate** | **~16,160 RPS** |
| **Avg Latency** | **181.65ms** |
| **p95 Latency** | **455.32ms** |
| **Total Success (202)** | 3,878,779 |
